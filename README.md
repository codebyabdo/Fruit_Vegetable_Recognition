```
4️⃣ Upload an image

The interface will allow you to upload a fruit or vegetable image and instantly display:

Predicted class

Processed image

Confidence score (if enabled)

📦 Dataset

This project uses the Fruit and Vegetable Image Recognition dataset from Kaggle:

🔗 https://www.kaggle.com/kritikseth/fruit-and-vegetable-image-recognition

The dataset contains:

High-quality labeled images

Balanced classes

Multiple fruits & vegetables
